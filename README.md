Riemann Logging Bundle
======================

Master: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/trademachines/riemann-logging-bundle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/trademachines/riemann-logging-bundle)

This bundle provides integration of [Riemann](http://riemann.io) library into
the Symfony2 framework.

Out of the box it sends one simple metric to Riemann and that is the duration
of the request. For more details take a look into the [documentation](docs/).

Integration with other bundles
==============================
If you are using the [Monolog Bundle](https://github.com/symfony/monolog-bundle)
there are some additional metrics send. Again take a closer look in the 
[documentation](docs/).
